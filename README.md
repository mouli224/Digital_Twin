# **Digital Twin Project**

This project combines hardware and software to create a unique experience where users can view a digital replica of any object along with all of its features in an interactive web application.

## **Project Overview**

- **Objective**: To construct a digital twin of a screw jack, incorporating both hardware and software components.
- **Tools Used**:
  - SolidWorks: For constructing the digital model.
  - Microcontroller: For collecting data from physical sensors.
  - JavaScript: For gathering and transmitting data.
  - Vue Framework: For rendering the data into the digital object.
  - Web Application: Interactive platform for viewing the digital twin.

## **Process Breakdown**

1. **Model Construction**:
   - The screw jack was designed and modeled using SolidWorks to create the digital replica.

2. **Sensor Integration**:
   - Essential sensors were installed on the physical model of the screw jack to collect data (e.g., motion, pressure, or position data).

3. **Data Collection**:
   - The data from the sensors is captured by the Microcontroller.
   - The collected data is transmitted to the local computer.

4. **Data Transmission**:
   - Using JavaScript, the data from the sensors is processed and transmitted.

5. **Digital Twin Interaction**:
   - The Vue framework is used to visualize the data and animate the digital model in the web application.
   - The digital twin will appear interactive once the server is turned on and running.

## **Final Outcome**

- An interactive web application that showcases the digital twin of the physical screw jack.
- Users can visualize the real-time data of the physical object through its digital replica.
