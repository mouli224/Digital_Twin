#It's a unique project that combines hardware and software, allowing users to view the digital replica of any object and all of its features in an interactive web application. 
#We used SolidWorks to construct a digital model of a screw jack and then turned it into a digital object. 
#We then installed a few essential sensors to collect data for a physical model.
#All of the information will be captured on an MicrocontrollerÂ and then transferred to our local computer.
#We have gathered the data using JavaScript and transmitted it to the digital object via the Vue framework. 
#Ultimately, an interactive web application featuring a digital twin of a physical object will appear once the server is turned on.
